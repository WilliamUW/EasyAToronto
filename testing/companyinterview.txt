About Equity Quantitative Research
Equity Quantitative Research (EQR) sits at the intersection of fundamental investment approach and
quantitative rigor and discipline. Teams of quantitative researchers and developers work together to build
and scale one of the largest equities portfolios in the market by optimizing various aspects of the
investment, risk management, portfolio construction, and trade execution lifecycle. EQR’s teams are small
and highly collaborative – each member makes meaningful contributions to the research agenda and
direction and has visible impact in Citadel’s investments.
Technology is at the core of the Equity Quant Research business. Embedded within EQR, the Engineering
team builds the tools and platforms that enable and drive our quantitative research. By building analysis
tools into a common platform, we empower EQR to work more effectively, easily share research and
collaborate on ideas. In addition to providing shared frameworks, the team makes ideas and models
production-ready and scalable so they can be applied in Citadel’s systematic trading environment.
Engineering in EQR is highly collaborative, and we are looking for people who can work effectively in small,
close-knit teams.
Key Responsibilities

EQR PREP FOR RECRUITER CALL
This will be a call with one of the recruiters and it will be more behavioral, but I have put together some prep that I hope will be
useful.
Things to know:
• EQR – one of the top performing teams within Citadel. Part of Citadel's Equities but not listed on their main website for
confidentiality as it is their competitive edge. It aims to address the challenges in fundamental equities by adopting a
quantitative and systematic approach.
• Initially a mini start-up quant fund, has become Citadel's second most profitable business unit, surpassing older business
units due to its aggressive growth. The team is made up of 150 individuals with about 75 in engineering and 75 in research
roles.
• Given their success they are looking to expand. They have 20+ engineering headcount, so they have adopted a team
matching based approach but the JD attached includes what they are looking for in general. (while it says QD, the roles are
engineering heavy positions, but with business exposure and that require candidates with an analytical mindset who can
connect the dots).
In this call they will cover:
1) Your motivations to move & interest in Citadel / finance and EQR. I have attached a generic jd but again, keep in mind there
is multiple headcount within the group so there are different roles you can be considered for.
2) Your projects , what your contribution has been (they have passed on candidates who couldn’t really talk in detail about
things on their resume or who did not really have a commercial mindset/ didn’t understand the downstream & impact of
their work)
Below I have summarized the notes from our catch up with them, which hopefully will help you frame your answers and give you a
bit of insight into which qualities they will be looking for!
They have realized that the candidates that do well throughout the process and on the job, are the ones that showcase economic
intuition and commercial awareness. What does this mean?
o Candidates that operate in context driven problem solving – focusing on business needs vs just focusing on deep technical
questions. Candidates that understand the context behind their projects and how their work fits into the larger business
strategy.
o They look for candidates who can articulate not just the technical aspects but also the economic and business rationale
behind their projects.
o If someone is too focused on solving performance and optimization problems, their desire is to solve a technical problem
they might not be the right fit
Key Qualities to Showcase
o Economic Intuition: Demonstrate an understanding of how your work fits into market dynamics and business strategies.
o Decisiveness and Pace: Be prepared to show that you can make informed decisions quickly and work effectively in fast-
paced environments. (some candidates come from companies / industries that are too slow paced and that doesn’t work)
o Commercial Awareness: Candidates should have a clear understanding of the commercial aspects of their work.
o End User and Impact: They should understand who the end user is and how their work impacts the broader business
o Visibility and Communication: Assess their ability to communicate effectively and demonstrate visibility within their
projects. Talk in a concise way. Communication can be looked at in 2 ways:
o Can the candidate take a methodical approach to how he is answering the questions
o Technical communication - can the candidate explain technical concepts digestible by someone that is not technical
Example questions they might ask (try to answer them keeping the points above in mind)
o Current Work: "Can you tell me about your current work and its impact on the business?"
o Problem Solving: "What types of problems do you want to solve?"
o Quantification: "Have you quantified your work? How do you measure its success?"
o Layman's Terms: "Can you explain your work in simple terms? Avoid overly technical jargon."
o Business Impact: "Why does your current work matter to the business?"
o Project Understanding: "Can you describe your most impactful project and its significance?"
o Business Model: "Can you explain the nature of your business and how the company makes money?"
o Broader Roadmap: "How does your current project fit into the broader roadmap of the company?"
o Core Problems: "Can you connect the dots between your work and the core problems the business is addressing?"
o Product Understanding: "What are you currently building, and who is the end user?"
o Business Impact: "How does your work impact the broader business?"
o Importance of Work: "Why is your current work important to the business?"
Example of feedback
Good Feedback:
o Motivation: Demonstrates strong motivation and a clear willingness to learn.
o Enthusiasm: Provides enthusiastic and engaged responses.
o Learning and Growth: Discusses how they picked up new topics and shows a clear understanding of their strengths and
weaknesses.

2. Technical Interview Topics
Core Coding Topics
Candidates should be comfortable with:
• Python Syntax & Data Structures: Lists, Hash Tables, Tuples
• Graph Algorithms: Connected Components, Best Friend Graphs, Network Flows
• Efficient String Manipulation: Palindromic Substrings, Substring Searches
• System Design & Scalability: Building fault-tolerant, high-availability systems
A. System Design Questions
1. Job Process API Design
Scenario: Researchers submit a large number of computational jobs that need processing.
Key Considerations:
• API Design:
o What endpoints do you expose? (/submit_job, /job_status/{id}, /cancel_job)
o What parameters does a job submission require? (priority level, compute resources)
• Job Prioritization:
o How do you handle urgent vs. normal requests? (FIFO, weighted priority queue)
• Concurrency & Queuing:
o Do you implement a job queue or a task-scheduling system?
o Use Kafka/RabbitMQ for buffering large job requests.
• Scaling & Failure Handling:
o Implement retry logic for failed jobs.
o How do you recover from node failures? (Distributed job tracking)
Follow-Up Questions:
• What database would you use for tracking job submissions?
• How do you prevent bottlenecks with simultaneous job requests?
2. Batch Processing Pipeline
Scenario: Users submit compute-heavy jobs, but you don’t know memory/CPU needs in advance.
Key Considerations:
• Dynamic Resource Allocation:
o Kubernetes/AWS Lambda for auto-scaling based on job type.
• Provisioning Containers:
o How do you decide how much CPU/memory each job gets?
o Track usage metrics (Prometheus, Grafana) and scale dynamically.
• Tradeoffs & Challenges:
o Some jobs are memory-intensive, others are CPU-heavy.
o Prevent network bandwidth exhaustion by throttling requests.
o Implement fair scheduling (e.g., round-robin, weighted allocation).
Follow-Up Questions:
• How do you prevent starvation of lower-priority jobs?
• How do you handle jobs that exceed allocated resources?
B. Business Case Problems
1. Restaurant Review Ranking System
Scenario: You operate a restaurant review site where users rate restaurants, but you need a better
ranking algorithm.
Key Considerations:
• If ranking ≠ mean score, what alternative ranking models exist? (Bayesian Averaging, Wilson
Score)
• How do you enable researchers to experiment with ranking models?
• Scaling to 1M+ restaurants – How do you make it fault-tolerant?
Follow-Up Questions:
• What data structures would you use to store reviews efficiently?
• How do you detect and filter fake reviews?
2. Spotify Royalty Analysis System
Scenario: Spotify wants to rank users based on profitability (royalties paid vs. cost incurred).
Key Considerations:
• What metrics determine profitability? (Subscription revenue vs. royalties)
• How do you process billions of song streams efficiently?
• ETL Pipeline: How do you structure data aggregation?
Follow-Up Questions:
• How do you handle delayed or incorrect data updates?
• How would your system adapt to new revenue streams like ads?
C. Graph-Based Algorithm Challenges
1. Palindromic Substrings
Problem: Find all substrings that are palindromes.
• Brute-force (O(n³)) – Check all substrings.
• Optimized (O(n²)) – Expand-Around-Center or Dynamic Programming.
2. Friendship Graph
Problem: Given a friendship network, determine:
• Connected components (friend groups) using BFS/DFS.
• "Best friend" groups – detecting trios or cliques.
3. Token Authentication System
Problem: Build a system for authentication token expiration & renewal.
• Efficient expiration tracking (priority queues, TTL indexes).
• Handling renewals & late requests correctly.
• Scalability for large-scale authentication.
3. Final Notes on Communication & Strategy
Show business intuition – Always tie technical solutions to commercial impact.
Think about scale & efficiency – EQR operates on large datasets.
Ask clarifying questions – Since there are no product managers, engineers drive priorities.
Communicate clearly – Be methodical in structuring your responses.
