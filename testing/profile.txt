👏 I LOVE Bloomberg!! 👏

In just my first two weeks:
1. 🏀 I got to see Stephen Curry visit and speak at our NYC HQ office. 🙌
2. 🏙️ All the interns were placed in the iconic New Yorker Hotel with breathtaking views of the World Trade Center, The Edge, and the Empire State Building all from our common room!
3. 🎟️ Discovered we have FREE access to 60+ museums and 20+ concerts & events in NYC—cultural paradise unlocked! 🖼️
4. 🥜 Enjoyed peanut butter on tap while overlooking Central Park at our 731 Lexington office! 😋
5. 👋 Met some of the friendliest and most interesting interns and full-timers ever!

I can’t wait to spend the next 4 months learning, growing, and making the most of NYC at this incredible company! 🌇💼

P.S. Friends in NYC, hit me up if you want a tour of the Bloomberg office! 🏢💬

🚀 $34,700 CAD in winnings 
🏆 14 hackathon wins 
🌍 9 cities, 3 countries, 2 continents in 3 months.

I went from not knowing game development 🎮 to building hackathon-winning Meta Quest 3 VR experiences using Unity and C# solo in under 8 hours, including most recently winning 2nd Place and $6,800 CAD at Microsoft’s GenAI Hackathon out of 1200+ participants!

I went from being intimidated by Solidity to deploying 50+ Rust, Cairo, and EVM smart contracts across 8 blockchain hackathons, including winning $8,800 CAD at the world's largest blockchain hackathon at ETHDenver ‘24 🌐—and even making headlines in a University of Waterloo article about my journey (which still feels surreal)! 

✈ My travels took me to London, UK for the first time, and to cities like Denver, Miami, Austin, NYC & more—a total of 9 cities across 5 timezones!

I owe so much to hackathons, which is why I am thrilled to announce the launch of Hackathons Canada 🍁 where you can discover upcoming hackathons, form powerhouse teams, and coordinate travel & stay with 1,100+ hackers across Canada!

In a world full of uncertainty, there’s no better feeling than knowing you can transform any idea into reality within a weekend. 🌟

I can’t wait to continue building—Thank you to all the amazing people I had the pleasure of meeting and learning from! 🙌

🏆 Absolutely thrilled to have won a combined $17,500 CAD with Xavier D'Mello at ETHDenver, the largest and longest-running Ethereum event in the world! 🎉🥳

🌎 Out of 21,000+ attendees from 120 countries this year, we are overjoyed to have won both 1st in main track judging as well as 1st in community voting with 978 votes! 🏆

🥇 This win means a lot to me since ETHDenver last year was my first Web3 hackathon, so coming back to where it all began and representing the University of Waterloo on the world stage was the best outcome I could have hoped for. 🙏

🙌 Thank you to:
- Waterloo Blockchain for flying me to ETHDenver in 2023 and introducing me to the world of blockchain.
- Benjamin Liang and Andrew Liang for your mentorship on Computer Vision/ML & Smart Contract integrations.
- Ivan Koparan, Adnan Mkamel, and Frederik Schulz for approving and accommodating my trip!
- Mayuri Punithan for interviewing me and writing this amazing article!

And thank you to all the amazing people I had the pleasure of meeting in Denver! 😄

Interview Behavioral Questions & Answers



Questions to ask:
Favorite and challenging aspect of your role at ?
What advice would you give yourself when you were graduating university? That’s the situation I am in right now so would love to hear any wisdom or insights you might have reflecting back

Tell me a little about yourself?

Hi, my name is William. I am a final year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Last year, I interned for Bloomberg in New York where I built internal tools with GenAI features to help lawyers draft contracts more efficiently. I am also joining Meta this Summer to work on their AI Reels Recommendation team.

In terms of interests, I love musicals, karaoke, strategy games, and hackathons! I have won 70 so far and over 180,000 in prizes.

Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake?

For sure! I made a small but very memorable mistake when I was in Barcelona earlier this month.

So I was in Barcelona on the first Sunday of April, which turns out to be Free Museum Day in Barcelona.

So I checked the closing times of each museum I wanted to visit that were free, starting from the ones that closed the earliest at 3pm all the way to 8pm.

Near the end of the day when I was checking out the museum of music in Barcelona, I arrived at 6:32pm and was excited to check out the museum for 25 minutes.

However, the receptionist told me the museum stops issuing tickets 30 min before closing.

So I ended up wasting 30 min on public transit to the museum and another 30 min to the next museum.

Two Lessons:
1. 30s of research or preparation can save hours down the line

In this case, if I just took the 30s to check the closing time on their official website, I would have known to come just 5 min earlier and it would have been fine. And saved the 30 min in transit.

This is also relevant in aspects like software engineering, where if you invest a few hours into learning a new tool such as Git or Cursor, it can save you hundreds of hours down the line.

2. When one door closes, another opens

Even though I missed out the music museum, I had 30 more minutes to spend at the museum of natural sciences of Barcelona, which was massive and I only got to see all the exhibits thanks to the extra time I had. So it ended up working out.

So to summarize, I missed the chance to see a museum for free in Barcelona due to not checking the closing time on their website. But I learned the lessons of the importance of research / preparation and how when one door closes, another one opens.

3. DE Shaw Interview Questions
Q1. Can you walk us through your resume, highlighting your experience relevant to the role
you are applying for at D.E. Shaw? (Background &amp; Experience)
How to Answer:
When answering this question, focus on your experiences that align with the job description.
Highlight your technical skills, any relevant projects, and experiences that show you possess
the qualities that D.E. Shaw looks for a candidate. Be succinct and structure your answer
in a way that tells a coherent story of your professional journey.

I believe my previous experience at Bloomberg is very relevant to the current role because I leveraged GenAI to help  the legal at Bloomberg work more efficiently. For instance, when lawyers at Bloomberg draft contracts, they have to select from a list of verified legal clauses that they use. So these legal clauses have been vetted by lawyers to ensure they will hold up in case they go to court. However, there are hundreds of these legal clauses spread out across over 30 playbooks (grouping of clauses), each containing dozens. 


What lawyers used to do was have all of these playbooks open as Word Documents, and manually scroll through to find the one that they want, which is extremely inefficient. What I ended up creating as a subcomponent of my intern project at Bloomberg was a side panel that allows you to type in what legal clause you are looking for, e.g. a clause that allows for early termination of the contract, and leveraging Bloomberg’s own LLM, it will automatically surface the most similar clauses ranked by a similarity score. 

So before searching for clauses to add might take minutes, now it just takes one click and a few seconds.



Q2. Why do you want to work at D.E. Shaw, and what interests you about our company?
(Cultural Fit &amp; Motivation)
How to Answer:
Your answer should reflect your knowledge of the company and its culture, as well as how
your personal values and career goals align with the organization. Mention specific aspects
of the company that appeal to you, such as its reputation for innovation, its commitment to
teamwork, or the opportunity to work on challenging projects.

From what I have read about DE Shaw, I know it is a very collaborative environment filled with extremely talented and hardworking and kind individuals. I feel this is the type of environment where I can learn and grow the most. Furthermore, the role I am applying for at DE Shaw involves GenAI in a financial context which is perfect for my background, because I have done Software Engineering internships at FinTech startups as well as big financial institutions like Bloomberg, and also technical operation roles at Canada’s largest VC firm.

Q3. How do you approach problem-solving, and can you provide an example of a
challenging problem you’ve solved? (Problem-Solving Skills)
How to Answer:
Demonstrate your problem-solving methodology with a structured approach, such as
defining the problem, analyzing the causes, exploring solutions, implementing a strategy,
and reviewing the results. Provide a specific example that shows your ability to tackle
complex issues effectively.

I approach problem-solving by breaking down problems into manageable subtasks, and completing them one by one to achieve something extraordinary. One example is my hackathon project for Microsoft’s GenAI hackathon, which I ended winning 2nd in out of 1200 participants, and I did it completely solo. I wanted to build Ironman’s JARVIS for this hackathon, so an AI agent that is both multimodal in terms of its input and output. 

For example, if you hold a solar eclipse glasses and ask what it is, the AI will use both your voice and video feed as input, and output both a spoken response as well as a 3D visualization of a solar eclipse with the Earth, moon and sun.

This was a massive undertaking especially for one person, so I had to subdivide this project, first into input, processing, and output. Then you have to subdivide even further. For instance, we have voice input and video input. Then within voice input, we have to recognize when the user starts speaking, when the user stops speaking, and convert that audio snippet into text. 

By breaking up this massive project into small manageable tasks, I was able to build out a JARVIS AI agent that leverages the Meta Quest 3 and Microsoft Azure’s GPT models to take in multimodal input (speech and video) and respond with multimodal output (speech and 3d visualizations).

The result was not just being the only solo team to win in the Top 3, but I was also paid by Microsoft twice to showcase my project to the Azure AI team and answer questions about my experience using Azure AI as a developer.

Q4. Describe a time when you had to work with a difficult team member and how you handled the situation. (Teamwork &amp; Interpersonal Skills)
How to Answer:
Recall a situation where you demonstrated empathy, communication skills, and the ability to
navigate interpersonal conflicts. Your answer should convey your capacity to maintain a
professional demeanor and work collaboratively, even in challenging circumstances.

One instance of dealing with a difficult team member was at Bloomberg when I was trying to get my web app deployed organization-wide at Bloomberg so the lawyers in our Beta testing group could play around with my app. But to do that, the app has to be reviewed by the Compliance team and approved.

I submitted a request for it to be reviewed. A reviewer was automatically assigned and despite me sending multiple follow up messages, a week passed without any response. Now this was nearing the end of my internship and my manager wanted to have something to show for my efforts so she was also asking me why the review hasn’t been completed.

Thus what I ended up doing was creating a group chat with me, my Manager, and the reviewer to explain the situation, how it is blocker for me making progress since we needed our lawyer team to test the app to get feedback and iterate. Furthermore, I requested a video call with the reviewer so I can show him the flow of my application and answer any questions he had on the spot instead of doing slow back-and-forths through the ticketing application. 

As a result, we ended up finishing the review process in a week and a half instead of the usual month that my teammates were used to, and my manager was very pleased that I was proactive in taking charging and navigating this process.



Q5. Explain the concept of a ‘P-Value’ in statistics and its relevance in data analysis.
(Technical Knowledge – Statistics)

Likelihood of seeing this particular set of observations if the null hypothesis is true.

Q6. How do you ensure the quality and accuracy of your work when dealing with large
datasets? (Data Analysis &amp; Attention to Detail)

Q7. What programming languages are you proficient in, and which do you prefer for data analysis? (Technical Knowledge – Programming)

I have used R in my statistics classes but I am most familiar with Python for data analysis. I have also used it in my Machine Learning course to train models that predict traits about a plant such as its height, temperature and precipitation data, as well as soil data like its PH value and sand content using a picture of it. We also had to submit our results to Kaggle.

Q8. Discuss a project where you applied machine learning techniques, and what was the outcome? (Technical Knowledge – Machine Learning)
How to Answer:
Outline the project’s objective, the machine learning techniques used, any challenges faced,
and the results achieved.

During my previous term, I took a course on Machine Learning. Our final project for this course was leveraging our Machine Learning knowledge to analyze a picture of a plant to predict its numerical traits such as its height, temperature and precipitation data, as well as the plant’s soil data like its PH value and sand content. One challenge I faced was that training one model to predict all of the traits was extremely inaccurate. As a result, I ended up training a separate model for each trait that takes in the plant’s image as input, then returns just one numerical prediction for that specific trait. This ended up being a lot more accurate, and I ended up receiving a modest 80% for this assignment when the class average was less than 65%. My final grade in the course was a 90% which I am very happy about since I was both job hunting and going to hackathons during the same time.

Q9. What experience do you have with financial modeling, and what tools do you use for it? (Technical Knowledge – Finance)

I learned some basic financial modeling at my VC internships, but never did it extensively in practice. For instance, I know how to perform DCFs, where you discount all future cash flows of a company to get its net present value. I also learned about comparables and precedent transactions, where you basically look at similar public companies or private companies that were sold, and look at ratios such as P/E or P/S to determine a possible valuation.

Q10. How do you stay current with the latest developments in the field of quantitative
finance? (Continuous Learning &amp; Industry Knowledge)

I am always going to hackathons, and there you get to see hundreds of projects leveraging the latest technologies which if I find intriguing, I learn it and integrate into my toolkit for the future.

Q11. Describe your experience with risk management and how you would mitigate risks in a portfolio. (Risk Management)
How to Answer:
When tackling this question, be sure to highlight your understanding of various risk
management techniques, tools, and strategies. Present your answer by explaining specific
experiences where you have implemented risk management measures. You can talk about
your familiarity with financial models, portfolio diversification, hedge strategies, and use of
financial instruments to mitigate risks.

One way to mitigate risks in a portfolio is to hedge. So a simple example would be to say you are long 100 AAPL stock, currently worth $200. What if one day it drops to $100? To mitigate this situation, you can buy Puts, giving you the option to sell AAPL at $200 regardless of what happens to the stock price.

Q12. Can you explain what a derivative is and give an example of where it might be used? (Technical Knowledge – Financial Instruments)
A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from the performance of an
underlying asset, index, or interest rate. They are primarily used for hedging risks,
speculating on future price movements, or gaining access to otherwise inaccessible markets
or assets.

The derivative I am most familiar with are options, which are a financial instrument whose value is derived from the performance of an underlying asset, a stock.

So for instance, if I buy a call option on AAPL, the call options price is determined by the price of AAPL stock. If AAPL stock goes up, my call option would likely increase (but not always) in value.

Q13. How would you handle a situation where you are given a tight deadline for a complex analysis? (Time Management &amp; Stress Handling)
How to Answer:

In responding to this question, discuss your ability to prioritize tasks, manage time
effectively, and maintain quality work under pressure. Explain your approach to breaking
down complex tasks into manageable parts and your experience in collaborating with others
to meet tight deadlines.

What I will do is outline the subtasks associated with it. I will inform my superior of how long each subtask will take but also the potential that the task might take longer due to the tight deadline. Once the plan is reviewed and approved, I will begin work to tackle each task and also reach out for help if I hit blockers. 

This ensures a systematic, efficient, and trackable way of delivering quality work under tight deadlines.

Q14. Provide an example of a time when you had to present complex data to a non-technical audience. How did you ensure clarity and comprehension? (Communication Skills)
How to Answer:
You should answer this question by giving a specific instance where you successfully
translated complex information to a lay audience. Detail your approach to making the data
digestible, such as simplifying terminology, using visual aids, and checking for
Understanding.

A lot of visual aids, explaining in simple to understand terms. Live walkthrough for how to use my application for the lawyers. Instead of focusing on the technicals and features, focus on the value for the non-technical person. E.g. instead of we query an AI to find similar clauses, rather you can enter in what clause you want and the panel lists the most similar ones.

Q15. In your opinion, what are the key traits of a successful trader, and do you possess these traits? (Self-Assessment &amp; Trade Skills)
How to Answer:
Reflect on the personal qualities and professional skills that enable a trader to perform well
in the fast-paced and often high-stress trading environment. Assess how you exemplify
these traits based on your past experiences and successes.

Q16. Can you discuss a time when you identified a new opportunity or inefficiency in the
market? (Innovation &amp; Market Understanding)
How to Answer
When answering this question, focus on demonstrating your analytical skills, market
knowledge, and innovation capabilities. Be specific about the opportunity or inefficiency you
identified, explain the approach you took to analyze the situation, and describe the steps you
took or would take to capitalize on the opportunity or rectify the inefficiency. Employers are
looking for evidence that you can identify and act on market signals in a way that benefits
the company.

Q17. What is your understanding of algorithmic trading, and have you ever developed or
improved an algorithm? (Technical Knowledge – Algorithmic Trading)
Algorithmic trading is the process of using computer programs to execute trades according
to pre-defined criteria, such as timing, price, and volume, with minimal human intervention.
Algorithms are designed to make trading more efficient and to capitalize on market
opportunities faster than human traders could.

Q18. How would you approach building a diversified investment portfolio? (Investment
Strategy)

Q19. What methods do you use to assess and manage the performance of a trading
Strategy?


Q20. Explain a scenario where you used data visualization to influence a business decision.
(Data Visualization &amp; Decision Making)

Q21. How do you prioritize tasks when working on multiple projects simultaneously? (Project Management &amp; Prioritization)
How to Answer:
When answering this question, it helps to demonstrate your ability to manage time
effectively, use prioritization frameworks, and communicate with stakeholders. Mention specific tools or methods you use, like the Eisenhower Matrix, Agile methodologies, or any
project management software.

I leverage the Agile method to deliver quality work consistently and verifiably. My team at Bloomberg leveraged Agile practices to ensure work is being done while constantly integrating customer feedback and collaboration with our team members.




Q22. Describe your experience with backtesting trading strategies and the tools you use for it. (Technical Knowledge – Backtesting)

I haven’t done backtesting before but I 

Q23. Can you give an example of how you have contributed to a team project and what role you played? (Teamwork &amp; Contribution)
How to Answer:
Your answer should include a specific example that showcases your ability to work
collaboratively, take the initiative, and contribute to a group effort. Be clear about the role you
played and the impact your contribution had on the project’s outcome.

I can talk about my experience at Start Hack, Europe’s largest entrepreneurial hackathon in Zurich, Switzerland. 

I was the most experienced member of the team. So I helped provide a lot of insights into the right tool to use, such as Vercel v0 for rapid prototyping, and React.js and Next.js for rapid deployment.

Also I was the most experienced when it came to pitching, so I was responsible for starting off our pitch to engage the audience, and passing it off to my teammates to run through the demo and conclusion.



Q24. What strategies do you employ to handle high-pressure situations in the workplace, particularly during market volatility? (Stress Management)

I remain logical by recognizing that emotions such as pressure are not directives. I take in emotions of feeling pressure as data points instead, but I don’t act on it. By recognizing the emotional impacts of high-pressure situations, I am better able to navigate it and make informed logical decisions and perform quality work. This is something I have perfected from my experiences at hackathons where you are forced to deliver an idea, product leveraging new technologies, demo, pitch all from scratch within 36 hours. 

Q25. How do you evaluate the ethical implications of investment decisions, and can you provide an example of how you have navigated an ethical dilemma? (Ethics &amp; Decision Making)
How to Answer:
Discuss your approach to ethical decision-making, emphasizing the importance of integrity,
transparency, and compliance with both legal standards and company policies. Share a real-
life example where you faced an ethical challenge and how you resolved it.
