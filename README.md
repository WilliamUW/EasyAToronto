## 🚀 2. How We Use Aptos

### 🎁 BBT: Behavioral Buddy Token

Submit real interview questions and earn **BBT** – our reward token built using Aptos' `managed_coin`.

### 🔐 On-chain Crowdsourcing

We store interview questions **on-chain** by company using Aptos `table::Table`, creating the largest open database of real interview Qs ever.

### 👤 Aptos Wallet = Anonymous Identity

We use your Aptos wallet as a pseudonymous identity — no logins, no tracking. Share only what *you* want.

> ✅ The more value you contribute (real questions), the more BBT you earn.
> 🔍 The more value you get (tailored prep), the better your interview odds.
