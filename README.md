## ❌ Behavioral Interviews Suck

Too many questions. No clear answers. Different expectations at every company. Most people just guess what to say — or pay \$\$\$ for coaching.

In 2024, over **\$2.4 billion** was spent on interview coaching alone.

---

## 💡 That’s Why We Built BehavioralBuddy

> 🎤 An AI that generates **perfectly personalized** answers to real behavioral questions — based on:
>
> * Your resume, LinkedIn, and work history
> * The company and role you're applying for

But where do the questions come from?

> ✨ From real people, like you — after their interviews.

We created a two-sided dApp that helps you **prep** better before interviews, and **contribute** after interviews to earn rewards.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 👟 Post-Interview Flow (Contribute & Earn)

## 🔗 How We Use Aptos

### 🎁 BBT Token

Users earn **BBT** for verified question submissions, built with `aptos_framework::managed_coin`.

### 🧠 On-chain Interview DB

Interview questions are stored **on-chain** by company using `table::Table`, creating a crowdsourced, open-access Q\&A dataset.

### 👤 Wallet = Identity

We use Aptos Wallet as a **pseudonymous identity layer** — no email, no forms, no friction.

> ✅ The more questions you contribute, the more BBT you earn
> 🔍 The more questions you read, the better your interview prep gets
